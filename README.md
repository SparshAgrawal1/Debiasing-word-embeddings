# Bias
Bias is a disproportionate weight in favor of or against an idea or anyparticular thing.  Biases can be natural or can be self-produced by the system. People may develop biases for or against an individual, a group, or a belief. Bias inmachine learning and natural language processing is an error in which data is moreinclined and weighted towards a gender, religion or community. Most of the widelyused datasets of NLP systems are found to be biased which can in return lead themodels to be discriminatory and toxic for humans.  Bias may also include contentproduced by humans.  Various sources of bias are stereotypical ideas, Text Corpus,Sampling error/ Non-sampling error, Programmer, etc.

# Word Embeddings
Word Embeddings are one of the most popular representationof document vocabulary in Natural Language Processing. They are capable of capturingcontext of a word in a document, semantic similarity, relation with other words.[5]They are vector representations of words in a multidimensional space and are widelyused in NLP to relate words to vector. These vectors are then used to improve modelsto give better accuracy.

# About the project
In this project we proposed a methodology to debias the word embeddings from bias(Gender) present

### In order to run the script
Download the word embeddings from the links given in respective folders and copy that files into their respective folders. Rename the embedding name and location in the code depending upon which embeddings you want to use.
